# Key Points:
Adding or Removing STL Files: The stlFilePaths array holds the file paths for your STL files. To add a new file, you'd push its path onto this array. To remove a file, you'd filter it out of the array.

Changing STL File Properties: Inside the loadSTL function call, I've added an example line to change the mesh material color to red. You can add more customization here.

Changing STL File Positions: After loading the STL files, they are stored in the loadedMeshes object. You can use this object to reposition them in the future.

Feel free to use this modified code as a reference to meet the specific requirements of your project.

# Introduction
This project is a web-based STL viewer developed using React and Three.js. It allows users to view and interact with STL files, which are often used for 3D modeling. The App.js script is the core part of the application and includes various features for managing STL files.

File Structure --> 
Here is the relevant file structure for this project:

src/
└── frontend/
    └── App.js
    └── application/
        └── STLLoader/
            └── STLLoader.js

* App.js: This is the main React component where the Three.js scene is initialized and STL files are loaded.
* STLLoader.js: This file contains utility functions for loading and managing STL files in the Three.js scene.

# How to Use:
Place the Files: Place the App.js script in the src/frontend/ directory of your project. Make sure you also have the STLLoader.js file in the src/frontend/application/STLLoader/ directory.

Initialization: The useEffect React Hook in App.js takes care of initializing the Three.js scene and loading the STL files. This runs once when the component mounts.

Run the Project: Start your React development server to run the project and view the STL files in a web browser.

# How to Edit for Future Use
Adding or Removing STL Files
To add or remove STL files, you'll need to update the stlFilePaths array in App.js

// To add a new STL file
stlFilePaths.push('path/to/new-file.stl');

// To remove an existing STL file
stlFilePaths = stlFilePaths.filter(path => path !== 'path/to/remove-file.stl');



# Changing STL File Properties
After loading each STL file, you can modify its properties. For example, to change its color:

mesh.material.color.set(0xff0000); // Set color to red


# Changing STL File Positions
To change the position of an already-loaded STL file, you can use the loadedMeshes object.

loadedMeshes['fileName'].position.set(newX, newY, newZ);



By understanding these sections and features, you can properly use and edit this script to manage STL files in your application. The script is designed to be easily adjustable for future changes.
