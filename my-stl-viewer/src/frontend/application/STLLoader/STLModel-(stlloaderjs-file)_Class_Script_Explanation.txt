Understanding the STLModel Class Script
=======================================

The code you see is essentially a blueprint for creating and managing 3D models from STL files. 
It's written in JavaScript and uses Three.js, a popular 3D library. Let's go line-by-line to understand 
what each part does.

---

Import Statements
-----------------
  import * as THREE from 'three';
  import { STLLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/STLLoader.js';

- What it does:  
  Imports necessary tools and functions from Three.js, a 3D library.

- Will it need to be changed?  
  No, unless you're updating to a new version of Three.js that changes how things are imported.

- Future Modifications:  
  If you need additional Three.js features, you can add more imports.

---

Class Declaration
-----------------
  export class STLModel {

- What it does:  
  Starts the definition of a new class called STLModel.

- Will it need to be changed?  
  No, this is the foundation of your blueprint.

- Future Modifications:  
  N/A

---

Constructor Method
------------------
  constructor(path, scene, options = {}) {
    ... (code lines)
  }

- What it does:  
  Initializes the class with basic settings.

- Will it need to be changed?  
  You might extend the defaultOptions to include more settings in the future.

- Future Modifications:  
  If you want to include more options like size or rotation, add them to defaultOptions.

---

Load Method
-----------
  load() {
    ... (code lines)
  }

- What it does:  
  Loads the STL file and places it into the 3D scene.

- Will it need to be changed?  
  Not unless you want to change how models are loaded or displayed.

- Future Modifications:  
  You could extend this method to add animations or to manipulate the model further after it's loaded.

---

Update Options Method
---------------------
  updateOptions(newOptions) {
    ... (code lines)
  }

- What it does:  
  Updates the settings for a model that's already been loaded.

- Will it need to be changed?  
  You may extend this method to handle more properties in the future.

- Future Modifications:  
  You could add more conditions to change other properties like size, rotation, or even add interactivity.

---

Comment Placeholder
--------------------
  // Add more methods for interactivity, annotations, etc.

- What it does:  
  Serves as a placeholder comment to remind you where to add more methods in the future.

- Will it need to be changed?  
  Yes, as you add more features.

- Future Modifications:  
  You could add methods for user interactions, annotations, or any other features you want.

This blueprint is flexible. You can keep it as is if it serves your needs, or you can add more features and options as your project evolves.
